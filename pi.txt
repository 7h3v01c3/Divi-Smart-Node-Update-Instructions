
This is instructions for updating Raspberry Pi Smartnode to Divi Daemon 1.0.8 

This is a tutorial for updating those who used the Divi Smartnode Image as described in the Github tutorial and my videos.
If you did a manual install not using the Divi Smartnode Image you can modify the directions and use it too. 

All instructions are at users' own risk!

On your desktop you already have divi-1.0.4, once done and confirmed 1.0.8 is running you can delete 1.0.4 folder

Steps

1. Open terminal

2. copy and enter this in terminal (hit enter)
wget https://github.com/DiviProject/Divi/releases/download/v1.0.8/divi-1.0.8-RPi2.tar.gz

This will download 1.0.8 Arm Build for Raspberry Pi


3.Copy and enter this in terminal (hit enter)
tar -xzvf divi-1.0.8-RPi2.tar.gz --directory /home/pi/Desktop

This will extract the new divi-1.0.8 directory to your Pi's Desktop.


4a. For Smart Node Version 1
Copy and enter this in terminal 

dli stop

(hit enter key)

Wait for  5 - 15 second and you should see the words "DIVI Server Stopping"

4b. For Smart Node Version 2
Copy and enter this in terminal 

diviservicestop

(hit enter key)

After a few moments, it will drop you to a command prompt

5. Copy and enter this in terminal

dli getinfo

We want to make sure that Divi daemon is not running. The response should say "error: couldn't connect to server" 
This is good!

6. Open your File Manager (3rd Icon on the top of your screen, looks like two folders)

7. You should now be in your /home/pi directory if not follow the folder tree to your /home/pi directory

8. In your /home/pi directory we will rename two files 

A. Locate .bash_aliases and right click on it and rename
.bash_aliases to .bash_aliases_backup

B. Locate divi-startup.sh and right-click on it and rename
divi-startup.sh to divi-startup.sh-backup

9. Import the two new files attached into the same directory /home/pi
When done you will see in /home/pi 
.bash_aliases
.bash_aliases_backup
divi-startup.sh
divi-startup.sh-backup

10. Close File Manager window

11 Go back to the terminal

12. Copy and enter this in terminal
reload
(hit enter key)

13a.For Smart Node Version 1
Copy and enter this in terminal (hit enter)

divistart

(hit enter key)

13b.For Smart Node Version 2

diviservicestart

(hit enter key)

14. Wait about 60 seconds then in terminal enter this 

dli getinfo

(hit enter key)

If it returns Error 28 the pi is still getting started (wait a few minutes)

when getinfo returns 

"version" : "1.0.8.0"

At the top, you now know all is working well.
